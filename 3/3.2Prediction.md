## How to make prediction with GPT2
Pedictions using the GPT-2 model, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Instantiate the Model**: Create an instance of the GPT2 class and load its parameters from a pre-trained checkpoint or train it on your dataset.

2. **Prepare Input**: Tokenize your input text and convert it into a format suitable for input to the model. Ensure that the input sequence length matches the maximum sequence length the model was trained on.

3. **Forward Pass**: Pass the prepared input through the model to obtain the logits for the next token.

4. **Apply Softmax**: Apply the softmax function to the logits to get the probability distribution over the vocabulary.

5. **Sample from Distribution**: Sample a token from the probability distribution obtained from softmax. This token will be the predicted next token.

6. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2-5 until you have generated the desired length of text or reached an end token.

Here's an example of how you can do this in code:

```
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Assuming you've instantiated and loaded your model already
model = GPT2(vocab_size=10000, hidden_size=256, num_layers=6, num_heads=8, feedforward_dim=1024, dropout_rate=0.1)
# Assuming you have some input text
input_text = "Once upon a time, there was a"
# Tokenize input text and convert it to tensor
input_tokens = [token_to_id[token] for token in input_text.split()]
input_tensor = torch.tensor([input_tokens])

# Generate text
generated_text = input_text
for _ in range(50):  # Generating 50 tokens
    # Forward pass
    with torch.no_grad():
        logits = model(input_tensor)
    # Apply softmax
    next_token_probs = F.softmax(logits[:, -1], dim=-1)
    # Sample from distribution
    next_token = torch.multinomial(next_token_probs, num_samples=1)
    # Append generated token to input tensor
    input_tensor = torch.cat([input_tensor, next_token.unsqueeze(0)], dim=-1)
    # Convert generated token to string and append to generated text
    generated_token_str = id_to_token[next_token.item()]
    generated_text += " " + generated_token_str

```

## How to build a loss function to train GPT2
To train the GPT-2 model, you need to define a suitable loss function that measures the discrepancy between the model's predictions and the actual ground truth tokens. Since GPT-2 is typically trained as a language model, the most common loss function used is the cross-entropy loss, also known as negative log likelihood loss.

Here's how you can build a loss function for training GPT-2:

**Prepare Ground Truth**: Convert your ground truth text into token IDs.

**Forward Pass**: Pass the input sequence through the model to obtain the logits for the next tokens.

**Calculate Loss**: Compute the cross-entropy loss between the predicted logits and the ground truth token IDs.

**Backpropagation**: Backpropagate the gradients through the network and update the model's parameters.

Here's a code example illustrating how you can implement this:
```
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def calculate_loss(model, input_tensor, target_tensor):
    # Forward pass
    logits = model(input_tensor)
    # Flatten the logits and target tensor
    logits_flat = logits.view(-1, logits.size(-1))
    target_flat = target_tensor.view(-1)
    # Calculate cross-entropy loss
    loss = F.cross_entropy(logits_flat, target_flat, ignore_index=0)  # Assuming 0 is the index of padding token
    return loss

# Example usage:
# Assuming you have already instantiated and loaded your model
# Assuming you have input and target tensors ready
input_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]])  # Example input tensor
target_tensor = torch.tensor([[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]])  # Example target tensor
loss = calculate_loss(model, input_tensor, target_tensor)
# Perform backpropagation and optimization step
loss.backward()
# Update model parameters using optimizer
# optimizer.step()
```

In this example, `input_tensor` contains the input sequence token IDs, and `target_tensor` contains the corresponding ground truth token IDs shifted by one position. You may need to handle padding and special tokens accordingly depending on your specific dataset and tokenization scheme.

Make sure to adjust the `ignore_index parameter` in the `F.cross_entropy()` function call to exclude any padding tokens from contributing to the loss calculation. Additionally, you may want to apply masking to ignore loss contributions from padding tokens in more complex scenarios.

## How to do that when there is no target_tensor
When training a language model like GPT-2 without specific target sequences, you typically use a technique called "teacher forcing" or "autoregressive decoding". In this approach, you generate the target sequences dynamically during training by shifting the input sequence by one position and using it as the target sequence. This way, the model is trained to predict the next token in the sequence based on the preceding tokens.

Here's how you can modify the training loop to accommodate this:

**Prepare Input**: Tokenize your input text and convert it into a format suitable for input to the model.

**Shift Input Sequence**: Shift the input sequence by one position to create the target sequence.

**Forward Pass**: Pass the input sequence through the model to obtain the logits for the next tokens.

**Calculate Loss**: Compute the cross-entropy loss between the predicted logits and the shifted input sequence.

**Backpropagation**: Backpropagate the gradients through the network and update the model's parameters.

Here's a code example illustrating this approach:
```
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def train_step(model, input_tensor):
    # Shift input sequence to create target sequence
    target_tensor = torch.cat([input_tensor[:, 1:], torch.zeros_like(input_tensor[:, :1])], dim=1)
    
    # Forward pass
    logits = model(input_tensor)
    
    # Calculate loss
    loss = F.cross_entropy(logits.transpose(1, 2), target_tensor, ignore_index=0)  # Assuming 0 is the index of padding token
    
    # Backpropagation
    loss.backward()
    
    # Update model parameters
    # optimizer.step()
    
    return loss.item()

# Example training loop:
# Assuming you have already instantiated and loaded your model
# Assuming you have input tensors ready
input_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]])  # Example input tensor

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    total_loss = 0.0
    for input_batch in data_loader:  # Assuming you have a data loader
        # Perform one training step
        loss = train_step(model, input_batch)
        total_loss += loss
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {total_loss / len(data_loader)}")

```
In this code:

* `train_step()` performs one training step. It shifts the input sequence by one position to create the target sequence, computes the loss using the shifted input sequence as the target, and updates the model parameters accordingly.
* `input_tensor` contains the input sequence token IDs.
* `target_tensor` is created by shifting `input_tensor` by one position. Padding tokens are added to the end to maintain the same sequence length.
* The loss is computed using `F.cross_entropy()` with the logits from the model and the target tensor. The `ignore_index` parameter is used to exclude padding tokens from contributing to the loss.
* The training loop iterates over the data loader, performs one training step for each batch of input data, and prints the average loss for each epoch.
