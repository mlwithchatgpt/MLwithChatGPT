## How to train GPT
Training GPT, or any large language model, involves a significant amount of computational resources, expertise in machine learning, and access to vast datasets. Here's a simplified overview of the process:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse and extensive dataset from various sources, including books, articles, websites, and other text repositories. The quality and diversity of the data greatly influence the model's performance.

2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to remove noise, standardize formatting, and ensure consistency. This step often involves tokenization, lowercasing, and other text normalization techniques.

3. **Model Architecture**: Choose the architecture of the language model. GPT models typically use transformer architectures due to their effectiveness in processing sequential data. Adjust the model size based on available computational resources and the complexity of the task.

4. **Training Infrastructure**: Set up a powerful computing infrastructure, usually with GPUs or TPUs, to handle the computational demands of training large models. Distributed training across multiple accelerators may be necessary for efficient training.

5. **Training Procedure**: Train the model using the prepared dataset and infrastructure. This involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize a predefined loss function, such as cross-entropy loss. Training may take several days or weeks, depending on the size of the model and the dataset.

6. **Fine-Tuning**: After initial training, fine-tune the model on specific tasks or domains to improve its performance for targeted applications. Fine-tuning involves training the model on a smaller dataset related to the task at hand.

7. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using appropriate metrics to assess its performance, such as perplexity for language modeling tasks or accuracy for classification tasks. Iterate on the training process based on the evaluation results to improve the model further.

8. **Deployment**: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for inference on new data. This may involve integrating the model into a software application or deploying it on a server for online inference.

Throughout the entire process, careful monitoring and experimentation are essential to identify potential issues and refine the model's architecture and training procedure. Additionally, staying up-to-date with the latest research in natural language processing is crucial for incorporating advancements into the training process.



## Provide the code to train GPT2 on a real dataset
To train a GPT-2 model on a real dataset, you'll first need to prepare your dataset in a format that the Hugging Face Transformers library can consume. Here's how you can do it:

Prepare Your Dataset: Ensure your dataset is in a text file where each line contains a single training example. If your data is in a different format, you'll need to preprocess it accordingly.

Tokenize Your Dataset: Use the GPT-2 tokenizer to convert your dataset into tokenized format. This is necessary for the model to understand the input text.

Instantiate the GPT-2 Model: Load the pre-trained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's model hub.

Define Training Arguments: Specify the training arguments such as the number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, etc.

Create Trainer: Create a Trainer instance with the model, training arguments, and your tokenized dataset.

Start Training: Run the train() method of the Trainer instance to start the training process.

Here's a code template to train GPT-2 on a real dataset:

```
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel, TextDataset, DataCollatorForLanguageModeling
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Path to your dataset
dataset_path = "path_to_your_dataset.txt"

# Load pre-trained GPT-2 tokenizer and model
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")
# Load and preprocess the Wikitext dataset
train_dataset = TextDataset(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    file_path="path_to_your_train_dataset.txt",  # specify the path to Wikitext train dataset
    block_size=128  # adjust according to your computational resources
)
eval_dataset = TextDataset(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    file_path="path_to_your_test_dataset.txt",  # specify the path to Wikitext validation dataset
    block_size=128  # adjust according to your computational resources
)
# Prepare training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./output",
    overwrite_output_dir=True,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,  # adjust based on your GPU memory
    per_device_eval_batch_size=4,  # adjust based on your GPU memory
    logging_dir="./logs",
    logging_steps=100,
    save_steps=500,
    eval_steps=500,
    evaluation_strategy="steps",
    save_total_limit=2,
)

# Prepare data collator
data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
    tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False
)

# Initialize Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()

# Evaluate the model
trainer.evaluate()

# Save the model
trainer.save_model("./gpt2-trained")


```
Replace `"path_to_your_train_dataset.txt"` and `path_to_your_test_dataset.txt` with the actual path to your dataset files. Adjust the training arguments and other parameters according to your specific requirements. After training, the fine-tuned model will be saved in the specified output directory (`./gpt2-trained`).

## Remarks
* `wandb` is needed for auto logging of training parameters and results. You can create an account on https://wandb.ai.
* To use a untrained model, instead of load model from pretrained ones, we can set the model config parameters by changing the default values for the model parameters
```
from transformers import GPT2Config
config = GPT2Config( vocab_size = 50257, n_positions = 1024, n_embd = 768, n_layer = 12, n_head = 12)
```

## Exerciese
* Fine tune the GPT model for text summarization dataset on the `samsum` dataset.
* Compare the model generation result before and after training.
* Compare the results between training and fine-tuning on pretrained models.
